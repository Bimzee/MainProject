        {\normalsize Internet and web applications have become very common these days. Web applications are accessible by anyone from any part of the world and hence is prone to more attacks. Due to limited time and resources, web application engineers need support in identifying vulnerable code which can be utilized for attacks. A practical approach to predicting vulnerable code would enable them to prioritize security auditing efforts. To evaluate web application security mechanism, a methodology and a prototype tool is proposed. The
       	methodology is based on the idea that injecting realistic vulnerabilities utilizing pattern matching in a web application and attacking them automatically can be
       	used to support the assessment of existing security mechanisms and tools in custom setup scenarios. The system tries to evaluate applications utilizing vulnerabilities in real web applications.
       	In addition to the generic methodology, the paper proposes the implementation of the Vulnerability \& Attack Injector Tool (VAIT) that
       	allows the automation of the entire process.
